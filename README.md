# Pyo OSC Tools

Wrappers around pyo's OSC methods to make prototyping easy.

To get a taste of what is possible, run the play_recording_example.py file.

Some OSC data was recorded from a leap motion using the record_leap.py script and the play_recording_example.py uses a subset of the collected data to parametrize some audio generators.
